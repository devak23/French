Q1. Why is "Farm animals" translated as "Les Animaux De La Ferme" where as "Zoo animals" is translated as "Les Animaux Du Zoo"  and why not "Les Animaux De La Zoo"
Ans:
"Farm animals" → "Les Animaux De La Ferme"
Here we use "de la" because:
"Ferme" (farm) is a feminine noun (la ferme)
When talking about things that belong to or are associated with a place, French uses "de + article"
"de + la" = "de la" (no contraction)
So: "animals of the farm" = "animaux de la ferme"

"Zoo animals" → "Les Animaux Du Zoo"
Here we use "du" because:
"Zoo" is a masculine noun (le zoo)
"de + le" contracts to "du"
So: "animals of the zoo" = "animaux du zoo"

Why not "Les Animaux De La Zoo"?
This would be incorrect for two reasons:
Gender mismatch: "Zoo" is masculine, so it needs the masculine article "le", not the feminine "la"
Missing contraction: Even if zoo were feminine, "de + la" doesn't contract, but since zoo is masculine, we need "de + le" which contracts to "du"
The Pattern
The general rule is:
Masculine places: "de + le" → "du" (du zoo, du musée, du parc)
Feminine places: "de + la" → "de la" (de la ferme, de la plage, de la montagne)
Plural places: "de + les" → "des" (des États-Unis, des Alpes)
So the translation is just about following French grammar rules about gender and article contractions!

Q2. Why  - "Je ne comprends pas" and not "Je ne pas comprends"
Ans: This is about a fundamental rule in French grammar regarding negation with compound verbs.
The rule: In French, negation uses two parts: ne + pas (or other negative words like jamais, rien, plus). These two parts wrap around the verb like a sandwich. The pattern is: ne + verb + pas

So: "Je ne comprends pas" (jun comphondre pah)  [Means I don't understand]
Why not "Je ne pas comprends"?
Because the negative particles must surround the conjugated verb, not come before it together. The verb needs to sit between ne and pas.
More examples:

Je ne sais pas (jun saay pah)  [Means I don't know]
Il ne parle pas (eel-n parley pah)  [Means He doesn't speak]
Nous ne mangeons pas (noon ne maun-jon-pah)  [n in jon is nasal; Means We don't eat]

With compound tenses:
When you have compound verbs (like passé composé), the ne...pas wraps around the auxiliary verb:

Je n'ai pas compris (jun ay pah kompree)  [Means I didn't understand]
Il n'est pas venu (eel ne est pas venu)  [Means He didn't come]

Think of it as:
Ne and pas are like two hands that grab the verb from both sides. They need the verb between them to complete the negative meaning.

Compound verbs in French are verbs made up of two parts: an auxiliary verb + a past participle (or infinitive).
The Two Types:
1. Compound Tenses (most common)
These use an auxiliary verb (avoir or être) + past participle:
Passé composé (present perfect):

J'ai mangé (I have eaten / I ate)
Elle est arrivée (She has arrived / She arrived)

Plus-que-parfait (pluperfect):

J'avais fini (I had finished)
Il était parti (He had left)

Futur antérieur (future perfect):

J'aurai terminé (I will have finished)

2. Modal/Semi-auxiliary Constructions
A conjugated verb + infinitive:

Je vais manger (I'm going to eat)
Il peut comprendre (He can understand)
Elle doit partir (She must leave)

Why This Matters for Negation:
With compound verbs, ne...pas wraps around the first verb only (the auxiliary or modal):

Je n'ai pas mangé (not Je n'ai mangé pas)
Elle n'est pas arrivée
Je ne vais pas manger
Il ne peut pas comprendre

The past participle or infinitive stays outside the negative sandwich.
Simple rule: The negative always hugs the conjugated/auxiliary verb, leaving the second part of the compound verb outside.
