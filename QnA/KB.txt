Q1. Why is "Farm animals" translated as "Les Animaux De La Ferme" where as "Zoo animals" is translated as "Les Animaux Du Zoo"  and why not "Les Animaux De La Zoo"
Ans1
"Farm animals" → "Les Animaux De La Ferme"
Here we use "de la" because:
"Ferme" (farm) is a feminine noun (la ferme)
When talking about things that belong to or are associated with a place, French uses "de + article"
"de + la" = "de la" (no contraction)
So: "animals of the farm" = "animaux de la ferme"

"Zoo animals" → "Les Animaux Du Zoo"
Here we use "du" because:
"Zoo" is a masculine noun (le zoo)
"de + le" contracts to "du"
So: "animals of the zoo" = "animaux du zoo"

Why not "Les Animaux De La Zoo"?
This would be incorrect for two reasons:
Gender mismatch: "Zoo" is masculine, so it needs the masculine article "le", not the feminine "la"
Missing contraction: Even if zoo were feminine, "de + la" doesn't contract, but since zoo is masculine, we need "de + le" which contracts to "du"
The Pattern
The general rule is:
Masculine places: "de + le" → "du" (du zoo, du musée, du parc)
Feminine places: "de + la" → "de la" (de la ferme, de la plage, de la montagne)
Plural places: "de + les" → "des" (des États-Unis, des Alpes)
So the translation is just about following French grammar rules about gender and article contractions!
